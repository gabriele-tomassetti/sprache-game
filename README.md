# Create a simple parser in C# with Sprache 

Everybody loves ANTLR, but sometimes it may be overkill. On the other hand, a regular expression just doesn’t cut it or it may be too complicated to maintain. What a developer can do in such cases ? He uses Sprache. As its creators say:

> Sprache is a simple, lightweight library for constructing parsers directly in C# code.
>
> It doesn’t compete with “industrial strength” language workbenches – it fits somewhere in between regular expressions and a full-featured toolset like ANTLR.

It is a simple but effective tool, whose main limitation is being character-based. In other words, it works on characters and not on tokens. The advantage is that you can work directly with code and you don’t have to use external tools to generate the parser.
